            Chala Secondary School is located in Chala / Njukini Ward / Division
            in Taveta Sub-County –Coast Region. The School is about 17km North
            of Taveta Town along the Rombo-Loitoktok Road. It stands on 24.06ha
            piece of Arable land and also boasts of a serene and an ambient
            environment very suitable for learning. The School was built back in
            1982 with a sole purpose of assisting the Girl child who was
            considered as a source of wealth but at later changed to a Mixed Day
            and Boarding School to date. <br />
            <br />
            The school has since then grown in leaps and bounds from an initial
            population of less than 50 students to the current population of 321
            as of February 2020 and the numbers are soaring. Key personalities
            who were very instrumental in the inception of the School included;
            Retired Senior Chief Rama Leshamta a well polished administrator
            adorned with several awards and recommendations to match. He is also
            an astute farmer and a family man.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Retired Chief, who was once a UT Teacher at Uganda, Kitobo and
            Mahoo Primary, later underwent administrative courses in Matuga,
            Embu, Maseno and Embakasi that saw him rise through the ranks to the
            post of a Senior Chief. He remarks himself as one of the nine Chiefs
            in the then larger Taita / Taveta District in which his location
            area covered; Chala, Mahoo & Njukini and with only Two Assistant
            Chiefs: for Mahoo and Chala / Njukini. That was the only location
            with nine Primary Schools but No Secondary School, yet it had the
            biggest population. <br />
            <br />
            The other location, Kimorigo already had Eldoro Secondary and
            Timbila Secondary School. In 1981, The Retired Chief therefore
            organized a Leaders’ Meeting which brought together the 9 nine
            Primary Headteachers, Religions leaders, Village elders, Business
            people and the Two Assistant Chiefs to discuss on
          </p>
          <li>Education Main Agenda</li>
          <li>Agriculture</li>
          <li>Health</li>

          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            On Education, the agenda was to elevate the then Chala Primary
            School which was where Chala Secondary School is today from
            semi-permanent structures to permanent buildings by trying to put up
            a minimum of two permanent classes annually. That was because the
            present Chala Secondary compound which had served as Chala Primary
            from 1956 to 1961 with those semi-structures had to be abandoned due
            to frequent flooding from River Lumi.
            <br />
            <br />
            The idea / proposal of putting up these permanent buildings as
            mooted in the1981 Leaders Meeting thus was adopted and forwarded to
            Taita-Taveta Council for approval and then to the District Education
            Board – DEB for rectification. In his tenure, the retired Chief had
            formed the Location Development Committee-LDC in which he was the
            Chair. The LDC Committee members comprised the:
          </p>
          <li>Social service officer as secretary</li>
          <li> The 9 Headteachers and 2 Assistant Chiefs as members.</li>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            Therefore, with the Rtd Chief being the Chair, the proposal was
            forwarded to the Divisional Committee then fast tracked to the
            District Development Committee under the DEB and Taita-Taveta
            Council who approved it. In 1982, the School was started under ACK
            sponsorship then CPK with Mr. Erick Mramba as the First Diocesan
            Head-Teachers (presently called Principals). The Head teacher then
            formed a School Committee chaired by the Retired Chief Rama. Some of
            the notable achievements /strides made by that team included:
          </p>

          <li>Registration of school.</li>
          <li>Construction of the Present Dorms for Boys and Girls.</li>
          <li>
            Construction of the Present School Dining Hall.Construction of the
            initial four classes which were built by parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            out sourced students from Mata, Kitobo, Njukini and Mahoo to boost
            numbers / students’ population
          </li>
          <li>Put up staff Quarters as source of income for School.</li>
          <li>
            Wooed / Coerced parents by giving them parcels of land 4 acres each
            so as to bring their children to school.
          </li>
          <li>
            Besides, the Retired Chief boosted Agriculture by introducing the
            Chala Cooperative Society that diverted River Lumi to foster the
            Economic power of his people.
          </li>
